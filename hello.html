        <h1>New lesson new file. Git Hub file</h1>
        <p>We are adding a commits, change to our file</p>
        <p>to do so we use <strong>git add</strong> as command</p>
        <p>let's say I did 10 different file, and I am happy with 3, I can do 3 commits to save all the different version to pick up in future</p>
        <p>like saying "I want to track this file"</p>
        <p>Load with add and shoot with git commit -m "message"</p>
        <p>After I add, I use commit to actually save the change with a comment</p>
        <p>One step is missing, still I see nothing online because I modified my local repository</p>
        <p>Using git status </p>
